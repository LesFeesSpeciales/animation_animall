# AnimAll

A fork of [AnimAll](https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Animation/AnimAll) by [Daniel "ZanQdo" Salazar](https://github.com/ZanQdo)

## Deprecation
This fork was merged into Blender’s `addons_contrib` repository. More
info on Blender’s [developer
site](https://developer.blender.org/T68332). The current version may
be found
[here](https://developer.blender.org/diffusion/BAC/browse/master/animation_animall.py).

This repo should no longer be updated.

<!-- ## Changes -->

<!-- * This patch allows keying only selected points for meshes, curves and lattices. -->
<!-- * Fix keying POLY splines -->
<!-- * Add fcurves to groups by element (Vertex, Edge, etc.), to keep the dope sheet and graph editor less cluttered -->
<!-- * This does not currently work for curves: the fcurves are unassigned on switching modes. Presumably due to a bug in Blender, since it works for meshes. -->
